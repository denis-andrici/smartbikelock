**Brief** 

This is a Smart Bike Lock system designed to combine hardware security with wireless control and mobile integration. The goal is to build a functional prototype that allows a user to lock and unlock their bike via a RFID tag.

**Objectives**

Design a prototype lock that locks and unlocks using RFID technology
Detects potential tampering and alerts owner (start via a buzzer and LED, build towards a phone notification)
Functions as a lock but merely a prototype to ensure proof of concept
Ensure sleek, compact and professional look. Avoid a block like design
